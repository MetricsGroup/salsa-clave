Salsa Clave 0.8
----------------
- Removed a feature from donation pages that enabled moving the "other" donation
  field above the main donation values. Unfortunately, this introduced a
  critical bug in which Salsa's own scripts would re-select another value when
  the "other" field was edited.

Salsa Clave 0.7
----------------
- Added additional options for customizing the unsubscribe pages.
- Added the ability to move "pre-donation text" from directly before donation
  amounts to directly after.

Salsa Clave 0.6
----------------
- Added the ability for donation pages to grab a variable from the URL and
  pre-fill a donation amount with that variable.

Salsa Clave 0.5
----------------
- Added support for unsubscribe pages.
- Added the ability to add accessibility attributes to required form fields and
  error messages.

Salsa Clave 0.4
----------------
- Adding support for storefront pages, items, and checkout.
- Improved selector peformance.
- Namespaced variables to the Salsa Clave package.

Salsa Clave 0.3
----------------
- Adding support for donation pages.
- Adding textareas to semantic classes (core).

Salsa Clave 0.2
----------------
- Refactoring to use variables instead of commenting to control features.

Salsa Clave 0.1
----------------
- First official commit.
- Support for core functions: semantic classes, removing forced clears.
